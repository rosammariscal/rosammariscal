### 👋 Hi, I'm Rosa María Mariscal Romero  
PhD in Engineering – Reservoir Simulation & AI Integration  
Postdoctoral Researcher at UNAM | Data Science & Energy Systems  

**Main Interests:**  
- Multiphase and multiporosity flow simulation  
- Machine learning & physics-informed models  
- Reservoir characterization and uncertainty analysis  

**Selected Notebooks:**  
- 🧮 [Mecánica de Fluidos](link) – Classic fluid mechanics exercises for petroleum engineering  
- 🤖 [Clasificación](link) – Supervised ML examples using reservoir data  
- 🔮 [Predicción](link) – Time-series forecasting for production data  
- 🌲 [RandomForest](link) – Ensemble modeling for property estimation  

# UnconventionalReservoirSimulatorLib

A Python-based library for simulating **multiphase flow in unconventional reservoirs** with complex fracture–matrix interactions.  
Developed as part of ongoing research on **fractal and fractional models** for anomalous diffusion and multiporosity systems.

## 🔍 Features
- Dual-porosity and dual-permeability formulations  
- Support for **non-linear flow regimes** and memory effects  
- Modular structure for numerical experiments and sensitivity studies  
- Written in **Python**, easily extendable for ML-assisted simulation or proxy modeling

## 🧠 Methods
Implements extended forms of **Warren-Root** and **Kazemi** transfer functions, integrating **fractional derivatives** for realistic matrix–fracture exchange.

## 🚀 Future Integration
Planned connection with neural-network proxies and **physics-informed models** for fast forecasting and history matching.

## 🧾 Reference
Part of my doctoral and postdoctoral research at **UNAM – Faculty of Engineering**.
